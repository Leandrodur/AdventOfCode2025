First time doing advent of code, what better way to do it than with C?

This is not serious C code, no error handling, no comments, no second though on logic, no optimization, irresponsable and spanglish variable naming.

Just for fun, lousy and inefficient code to pass the day.

Consider yourself warned and proceed at your own risk.
